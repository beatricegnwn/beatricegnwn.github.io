	<h1>5G is the fifth generation in wireless technology that promises to be a faster, more responsive, and highly reliable network. As with previous wireless technologies, 5G is a great big network that will change our lives in ways we never considered and unleash a wave of innovation. With this innovation comes new 5G compatible devices. 5G service requires a compatible 5G phone and plan.</h1>
	<h2>The most noticeable improvement with 5G over what the iPhone offers today is faster connectivity, hence Apple's "Hi, Speed" invite. 5G can run between 10 and 100 times faster than your typical 4G cellular connection, making downloads and video streaming snappier than ever. Importantly, 5G's latency -- the amount of time between when your phone pings the network and when the network responds is much faster than what 4G and even Wi-Fi provide. Apple typically isn't the first to introduce new technology, like mobile payments and wireless charging. It was at least a generation behind in adopting 3G and 4G LTE cellular capabilities in earlier iPhones. But once it jumps in, it tends to dominate and shape the market in ways other handset makers can't.</h2>

<meta name="og:description" content="The advent of fifth-generation (5G) wireless network technology are the revolution and has been keenly anticipated by consumers seeking its unique benefits for their daily lives. However, some have questions and concerns about challenges they may face. Will 4G phones work on 5G networks? When will 5G be available? 5G will affect existing 4G networks. But where you might get 10Mb per second from your 4G network today, 5G could possibly provide 100MB per second everyday speeds. It’s a big leap forward and it will change the way we use our mobile devices. Since 5G can operate at such a high frequency, we’ll see huge speed increases and support for massive data transfers">

	<h1>Right now, 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology is only capable of using lower frequency bands, operating up to 6GHz, whereas the radio bands that 5G will be able to handle will be anywhere between 30GHz and 300GHz1.

 	<h1>How can i tell if my phone is 5g?</h1>
 	<h2>To know if your phone is 5G is to Google up its specs online. You’ll most likely land on Gsmarena which boosts the biggest database of smartphones specs in the world. 5G the much-hyped next generation of mobile technology is here. A growing number of countries including the U.S, Canda, China, India, U.K, South Africa, Japan, South Korea have piloted some form of 5G network. </h2>

 	<h3>if your network provider is Verizon, you must check if the 5G phone you are getting supports mmWave; otherwise, the phone's performance will not be as fast, although it covers a wider area. According to OpenSignal's report on 5G network performance, Verizon may have the fastest 5G, but the poorest availability on 5G network. In contrast, T-Mobile has the most extensive 5G reach, but the speed is only slightly faster than LTE.</h3>
  <h4>According to Toms Guide, aside from 5G networks, buyers must also consider the processor, screen size, cameras, and other specs, just like when buying a regular smartphone. However, since 5G can exhaust the phone's power much faster than regular smartphones, it is highly significant to get high performing battery.</h4>
